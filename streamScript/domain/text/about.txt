Welcome to TweetTrack. Please click on the "Track Me" button
to enter your Twitter handle and we'll do our
best to make a prediction of where most of your tweets are coming from. Click
"yes" or "no" to let us know how we did!

Our site builds on research carried out by a team at IBM (link: http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1403/1403.2345.pdf)
that analyzes the content of tweets to predict where users are tweeting from.

We use a basic supervised machine learning approach to create our model. After collecting
roughly 7 million tweets from users within the United States, we used the 2012
US Census records to identify the 100 most populous cities in the United States.
We then queried Twitter's API to get the 200 most
recent tweets for 101 users for each city and trained a multinomial Naive Bayes
classifier on the texts of those tweets. When you enter a twitter handle, we send
a query to Twitter's API for the most recent 200 tweets. If we get at least 100 tweets
back, our classifier analyzes your tweeting style and returns the city from our list
which most closely matches the contents of your tweets.
